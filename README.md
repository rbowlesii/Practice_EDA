# Dirty Café Sales — Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project dives into the **Dirty Café Sales dataset** from Kaggle. The goal was to get some hands-on practice with **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** while working through a “real world–style” messy dataset.  

The main objectives were to:  
- Clean and standardize the data  
- Handle missing values and duplicates  
- Detect and address outliers  
- Create visualizations for sales trends  
- Explore correlations between key variables  

This is my **first practice project** I’m uploading to GitHub as I start building out my data science portfolio. Think of it as me getting warmed up in public.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy for wrangling data  
- Matplotlib (and a bit of Seaborn for cleaner plots)  
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and storytelling

## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Spotted and handled missing values and duplicates  
   - Standardized column names into snake_case  
   - Cleaned up inconsistent entries (messy café data needs tidy tables!)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Descriptive stats (mean, median, std dev)  
   - Outlier detection and adjustments  
   - Sales breakdown by item and payment method  
   - Correlation checks between numerical features  

3. **Visualizations**  
   - Bar charts and histograms  
   - A look at how messy raw data can turn into meaningful patterns

## 🚀 Results & Insights
- Built a cleaned dataset ready for further analysis  
- Identified which items sell the most  
- Spotted common payment habits across customers  
- Noted a few outliers that could’ve skewed the story if left unchecked
